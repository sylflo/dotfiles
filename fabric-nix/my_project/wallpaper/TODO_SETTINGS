  #     --fill-color <FILL_COLOR>
  #         Which color to fill the padding with when output image does not fill screen
          
  #         [default: 000000]



  #     --transition-fps <TRANSITION_FPS>
  #         Frame rate for the transition effect.
          
  #         Note there is no point in setting this to a value smaller than what your monitor supports.
          
  #         Also note this is **different** from the transition-step. That one controls by how much we approach the new image every frame.
          
  #         [env: SWWW_TRANSITION_FPS=]
  #         [default: 30]

  #     --transition-angle <TRANSITION_ANGLE>
  #         This is used for the 'wipe' and 'wave' transitions. It controls the angle of the wipe
          
  #         Note that the angle is in degrees, where '0' is right to left and '90' is top to bottom, and '270' bottom to top
          
  #         [env: SWWW_TRANSITION_ANGLE=]
  #         [default: 45]

  #     --transition-pos <TRANSITION_POS>
  #         This is only used for the 'grow','outer' transitions. It controls the center of circle (default is 'center').
          
  #         Position values can be given in both percentage values and pixel values: float values are interpreted as percentages and integer values as pixel values eg: 0.5,0.5 means 50% of the
  #         screen width and 50% of the screen height 200,400 means 200 pixels from the left and 400 pixels from the bottom
          
  #         the value can also be an alias which will set the position accordingly): 'center' | 'top' | 'left' | 'right' | 'bottom' | 'top-left' | 'top-right' | 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-right'
          
  #         [env: SWWW_TRANSITION_POS=]
  #         [default: center]

  #     --invert-y
  #         inverts the y position sent in 'transiiton_pos' flag
          
  #         [env: INVERT_Y=]

  #     --transition-bezier <TRANSITION_BEZIER>
  #         bezier curve to use for the transition https://cubic-bezier.com is a good website to get these values from
          
  #         eg: 0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0 for linear animation
          
  #         [env: SWWW_TRANSITION_BEZIER=]
  #         [default: .54,0,.34,.99]

  #     --transition-wave <TRANSITION_WAVE>
  #         currently only used for 'wave' transition to control the width and height of each wave
          
  #         [env: SWWW_TRANSITION_WAVE=]
  #         [default: 20,20]
